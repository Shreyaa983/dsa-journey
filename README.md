# 🧠 DSA Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** preparation journey!

This repository documents my structured practice of 180+ handpicked DSA questions, organized by topic and difficulty level. The questions are based on **Striver's SDE Sheet**, one of the most widely respected roadmaps for software engineering interview preparation.

## 🎯 Goal

To master fundamental and advanced DSA concepts through consistent, focused practice — and to improve both my problem-solving depth and coding fluency.  
I’m tracking my learning across five revision levels to ensure spaced repetition and retention.

## 📈 Revision Strategy

Each topic is revised through five progressive levels:

| Revision | Level Description               | Problem Count |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Rev 1    | Very Easy Questions             | 10–15         |
| Rev 2    | Easy Questions                  | 8–10          |
| Rev 3    | Medium Level (Round 1)          | 10–12         |
| Rev 4    | Medium Level (Round 2)          | 10–12         |
| Rev 5    | Company-Specific/Advanced Focus | varies        |

## 🧩 How I Solve Each Problem

I'm following the 6-step problem-solving strategy by **Anthony D. Mays** (former Google Engineer):

1. 🗣️ **Repeat** the problem aloud to ensure understanding and buy time.
2. ❓ **Ask clarifying questions** to validate assumptions.
3. 🔍 **Work through examples** to understand edge cases and behavior.
4. 💡 **Brainstorm multiple solutions**, aiming for the most optimal.
5. 💻 **Implement correct code** in C++/Python — no pseudocode.
6. 🐞 **Test thoroughly** with edge cases and step-by-step walkthroughs.
